Miscellaneous GIFs made with code, primarily using openFrameworks and
GLSL (sometimes Pure Data, p5.js, and TouchDesigner). Most of these
are the product of learning and practicing, rather than with a
specific outcome in mind. Techniques include raymarching, feedback loops,
geometry instancing, glitching through compression/resampling,
framebuffer manipulation, dithering, etc.
