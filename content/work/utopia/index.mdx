_Hello Tiree._

Hello Isaac.

_Who are you?_

I am Tiree John Cook Boston.

_And who is Tiree John Cook Boston?_

I am a young engineer in training, also a farmer, a crofter... I do many other things as well. I'm a trained ROV (remotely operated vehicle) pilot & technician, so flying big machines underwater. I have training in high voltage electrics... what else? I'm planning on being a mechanical engineer, I do things in my spare time: I rebuilt a motorcycle, rebuilt a car, and I'm building a farm.

_How do you find all the time for this?_

It's my 9—5, my life pretty much. Week in week out, a 24/7 lifestyle.

_If you could bring all of those titles into one, what would you call yourself?_

I don't know if there's a broad term really, because there's a mix of farming, engineering, sailing, landscaping, and geology if we're doing rock samples or quarrying, which we've done before as well. I've done surveying, I do design on the computer. So, I guess its just all-round engineer.

_An engineer._

Yes.

_Where do you do all of this?_

I live on the West Coast of Scotland, in the middle of nowhere. I live there as more of a lifestyle, its a choice. I choose to live on the outside of society, because its calmer... peace. You can do whatever you feel like, you can chase your passion.

_Are you unpoliced?_

Unpoliced. So I can do what the f\*\*\* I want!

_So what do you do with all this freedom?_

So being an engineer, I can craft many crafty things. I keep animals; I have eight dogs, a cat, three horses, and about a hundred sheep. We breed the sheep every year, whilst building up the farm and putting in infrastructure, buildings, generators.

_What is your long term view for this farm?_

Set it up so we can be self-sufficient, so we don't need to work for a living. It makes it's own money.

_Excluding your family, what is your personal plan for the farm?_

My personal vision is to pursue what I want to do, anything you can possibly think of, really. I want to build stuff, I want to own drones, building with drones! Drone technology, man! Which is made possible with our links with the [redacted]. As a family we're working on diving projects up there [Scotland], we're trying to build a submarine.

_A submarine?_

The submarine is this little jetski-boat, that sinks when you press a button; these tanks deflate. You can control it underwater, its something I want to finish. I have visions for cars, and so on.

_What do you want to get out of your farm?_

What I want out of my piece of utopia is freedom.

_Do you feel like you could achieve this freedom anywhere else?_

Well, we tried to do it here [the South West], we wanted to set it up to be this big marine hub which would bring in so much income that it would help expand the local businesses, bringing money into the area.

_So, jump starting an area?_

Yeah, so basically restart an area. This [town in South West] was a run down area. It was going to be completely rebuilt to be fancier than any other stuff then, new age.

_Would that encompass the whole of [town in South West]?_

It would be the whole of this [5 acre yard] and housing out on [redacted] road. The council denied it, so we took them to court. We want to do something amazing here, but their argument was that it was a gamble, and it was going to cost too much money, and if we f\*\*\*\*d it up it'd be an economical blow to [town in South West\*\*.

_What did you do?_

After being denied, we decided to say f\*\*\* it, we're going to move to Scotland, start afresh and build a future for my generation, and generations to come. Something to pass on. We set it up so money doesn't go through a person, it goes through a company, and the family owns the company. It's designed so nobody can take a bite out of our cherry pie. We can say f\*\*\* off, this is staying in the family because that's the way the company works.

_Will this company be able to function and expand without bringing in lower level people who aren't family?_

Yes, currently my dad owns the company, with share investors and employees that are family. We've set it up so we don't have to rely on anyone, for anything. Money-wise, our costs are lower because of the structure, but its legal. It's legal. It's all legal! [to microphone] F\*\*\* off tax man!

_[We discuss Rajneeshpuram, a failed 1980's settlement based on utopic ideas, with citizens worshipping the towns leader]_

_Is this what your utopia will be like?_

No, no, but along the same vision of build a future, and build it independent from the rest of the world so you can self-sustain. You can go off and travel, you don't have to worry about a job, or where you can stay, or how you're going to eat. We'll always have food, water, shelter, power. You could travel the world and come back to this safe haven, that's always going to be running. The company and the infrastructure are being set up so it'll always be active.

_How are you doing this?_

We're building it from the start. You look at the pictures [from a few years ago] and its like a blank canvas. Just a few houses and some fields, but we're getting there.

_Do you have a political persuasion?_

I don't follow politics. You can't get it your way, I'd rather just f\*\*\* off and build a new place.

_You can't really get away from politics, there's always someone governing, everywhere._

Whatever you want to do, or what you think is best for your family, its your future. You might not be able to do that because there's restrictions in place. Say I wanted to dig up some land and create these ponds, lakes, and a sanctuary, the government might stop me.

_Is that something you want to do?_

Yes. I want to dig these huge lakes, we've already got the trees planted, we planted half a million of them. We want to make it work so we can build all this amazing s\*\*\*.

_Who's allowed in? Into this community?_

Anyone is welcome. A road runs through our land, I want to section it off to make this ravine around the edge, and connect us with bridges to the outside, so people can get in. Then I'll fence it off with natural woodland. Our own wooded area, away from the rest of the world.

_Do you want to expand? If so, how do you expand?_

Well we've got a new yard, up the road from us. We're setting that up as another form of income, to help sustain and help build the main area. It'll double our income. We can repeat this and keep on expanding and expanding and expanding. At the moment we're working on our main yard, it's bigger than we need or want. A lot of our land came as a bundle deal. Currently it's just empty marshland for miles and miles, which we're slowly bringing back to life. Next year we're going to dig drainage for the marsh and drain the land, which we'll use to fill the lakes in the forest. If there is a forest fire, we can dip into the water from the lakes, which are positioned to prevent spread, too. We're planning it out, but its coming along slowly at the moment.

_Do you think you'll live to see it done?_

I don't know, I'm going to take it to my grave. That's my plan. We're close [to rapid expansion] because as soon as we sell this yard in [town in South West] we'll have a big fist full of cash, which we can use to fund ourselves to generate more money. It's the smallest area, but we're going to start expanding. Make the ground great again.

_Does your community have a name?_

What, my utopia? Well we're only just setting up the small stuff, so we will have somewhere to work from, the ground works for something bigger. It'll go from the next person to the next person, it's not just one person, it's f\*\*\*\*ing twenty people.

_So your family are in on it as well?_

My parents are in on it yes, my dad has put his heart and soul into it. That's why he's fighting for this, it's why he's p\*\*\*ed off. We're struggling to get money for this [yard in town in South West]. Because the f\*\*\*\*ing government are stopping us!
